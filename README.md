# camro-bot

Hello! Welcome to my repository for the camro discord bot.

camro bot is currently in alpha stage and is very new, there is no command handler and is very sparse on features as of right now. This will be a project I may take some time on as I am constantly learning different languages and trying to find a suitable one for this project, I previously wrote this in python and am now considering switching to Golang.

# v.0.1
Camro bot has these features:

help - displays help for the bot  

av - view your own avatar, or specify a user to view their avatar

kick - kick a mentioned user from your guild

server - view information about the current guild

ping - view latency and api latency
